# UwUifier
C++ program that takes a text input and uwuifies it. Great for furry rp. 

# Setup
1. Install the .exe file (you may also opt to install the .cpp file instead if you have a way to compile it)
2. Create a file called "input.txt" in the same directory as the .exe file 
3. Put some text into the .txt file you just created. 
4. Open the .exe file
5. The uwuified text should be output into the same directory in a text file named "output.txt"
